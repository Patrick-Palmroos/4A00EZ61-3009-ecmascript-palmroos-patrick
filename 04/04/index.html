<!-- this shows true in the console because its asking if
this == window, which it is since in browsers this
tries to be the global object which in this case is called
window-->

<!--
this.key1 = "donald duck" ====> changes key1 value to "donald duck"

window.key2 = "mickey mouse" ====> does the same thing but for key 2 since window and this
refer to the same object in this object in this scenario

var key3 = "uncle scrooge" ====> this changes the value of key 3 to uncle scrooge.
I assume that this works since var is basically also window.var
